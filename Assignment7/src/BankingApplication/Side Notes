Assignment 4-7 with banking application and the modifications needed to be made left me disorganized 
and unable to fit some of the implementations. I tried the best I could with what I know and had at hand.
 
The current banking program is different from the other bank programs I have submitted.
I tried to do as much as I could but could not finish.
